Configuration
=============

Out of the box django-cms comes not with a lot features. But with some settings you can extend it to a enterprise ready solution.
All settings described here can be found in cms/settings.py or in the plugins folder if they have a settings.py

All thoose settings should be placed in your project settings.py

CMS_TEMPLATES 
--------------

A list of the templates you can select for a page.

Example::

	CMS_TEMPLATES = (
		('base.html', gettext('default')),
		('2col.html', gettext('2 Column')),
		('3col.html', gettext('3 Column')),
		('extra.html', gettext('Some extra fancy template')),
	)

CMS_TEMPLATE_INHERITANCE
------------------------

This is optional

Example::

    CMS_TEMPLATE_INHERITANCE = True

If this is enabled, pages have the additional template option
to inherit their template from the nearest ancestor. Adding new
pages defaults to this if the new page is not a root page.  

CMS_PLACEHOLDER_CONF
----------------------

Is used to configure the placeholders. 
This is optional.

Example::

	CMS_PLACEHOLDER_CONF = {
		'content': {
			'plugins': ('TextPlugin', 'PicturePlugin'),
			'text_only_plugins': ('LinkPlugin',)
			'extra_context': {"width":640},
			'name':gettext("Content")
		},
		'right-column': {
			"plugins": ('TeaserPlugin', 'LinkPlugin'),
			"extra_context": {"width":280},
			'name':gettext("Right Column")
			'limits': {
				'global': 2,
				'TeaserPlugin': 1,
				'LinkPlugin': 1,
			},
    	},
    	'base.html content': {
    		"plugins": {'TextPlugin', 'PicturePlugin', 'TeasePlugin'}
    	},
	}

You can combine template names and placeholder names to granually define the plugins like done with ''base.html content''.
	
**plugins**

A list of plugins that can be added to this placeholder. If not supplied all plugins can be selected.

**text_only_plugins**

A list of additional plugins that should only be available to the TextPlugin, but can't be added directly to this placeholder.

**extra_context**

Extra context that plugins in this placeholder receive.

**name**

The name displayed in admin. With the gettext stub it can be internationalized.

**limits**

Limit the number of plugins that can be placed inside this placeholder. 
Dictionary keys are plugin names; values their respective limits. 
Special case: "global" - Limit the absolute number of plugins in this 
placeholder regardless of their type (takes precedence over the type-specific
limits).


CMS_PERMISSION
--------------

Example::

	CMS_PERMISSION = True
	
If this is enabled you get 3 new models in Admin:

- Pages global permissions
- User groups - page
- Users - page

In the edit-view of the pages you can now assign users to pages and grant them permissions.
In the global permissions you can set the permissions for users globally.

If a user has the right to create new users he can now do so in the "Users - page". But he will only see the users he created.
The users he created also can only have the rights he already has. So if he has only the right to edit a certain page all users he created also only can edit this page. 
Naturally he can even more limit the rights of the users he creates.


CMS_MODERATOR
--------------

Example::

	CMS_MODERATOR = True
	
If set to true gives you a new column "moderation" in the tree view.
You can select to moderate pages or hole trees. If a page is under moderation you will receive an email if somebody changes a page and you will be asked to approve the changes. Only after you approved the changes they will be updated on the live site. If you change a page you moderate yourself you will need to approve it anyway. This allows you change a lot of pages for a new version of the site and can go live with all the changes on the same time.



CMS_SHOW_START_DATE & CMS_SHOW_END_DATE
----------------------------------------------

Example::

	CMS_SHOW_END_DATE = True
	CMS_SHOW_START_DATE = True
	
This adds 2 new date-time fields in the advanced-settings tab of the page.
With this option you can limit the time a page is published.

CMS_URL_OVERWRITE
-------------------

Example::

	CMS_URL_OVERWRITE = True
	
This adds a new field "url overwrite" in your in the advanced-settings tab of the page.
With this field you can overwrite the whole relative url of the page.


CMS_MENU_TITLE_OVERWRITE
---------------------------

Example::

	CMS_MENU_TITLE_OVERWRITE = True

This adds a new field "menu title" besides the title field.
With this field you can overwrite the title that is displayed in the menu.

To access the menu title in the template use::

	{{ page.get_menu_title }}

CMS_REDIRECTS
--------------

Example::

	CMS_REDIRECTS = True
	
This adds a new field "redirect" to the advanced-settings tab of the page
You can enter a url and if someone visits this page he gets redirected to this url.

Note: Don't use this too much. There is django.contrib.redirect for this purpose

CMS_SEO_FIELDS
----------------

Example::

	CMS_SEO_FIELDS = True

This adds a new Fieldset "SEO Fields" in the page admin. You can set there the Page Title, Meta Keywords and the Meta Description

To access the fields in the template use::
	
	{% load cms_tags %}
	<head>
		<title>{% page_attribute page_title %}</title>
		<meta name="description" content="{% page_attribute meta_description %}"/>
		<meta name="keywords" content="{% page_attribute meta_keywords %}"/>
		...
		...
	</head>


CMS_FLAT_URLS
---------------

Example::

	CMS_FLAT_URLS = True
	
If this is enabled the slugs are not nested in the urls.

So a page with slug "world" will have an url "/world" even it is a child of the page "hello"
If disabled the page would have an url: "/hello/world/"


CMS_NAVIGATION_EXTENDERS
------------------------

XXX: OUTDATED

Example::

	CMS_NAVIGATION_EXTENDERS = (
		('shop.navigation.get_nodes', 'Shop Categories'),
		('gallery.navigation.get_nodes', 'Galleries'),
	)


Navigation extenders allow you to extend the menu. 
In Brief: A tuble with a python path to a function that returns a list of navigation nodes	
For detailed explanation read the navigation docs section :ref:`extending_the_menu`.

This gives you a new field in the advanced-settings tab of the page. You can there say that one navigation extender is attached to this page.

CMS_NAVIGATION_MODIFIERS
------------------------

XXX: OUTDATED

Example::

	CMS_NAVIGATION_MODIFIERS = (
		('blog.navigation.add_blog_categories'),
	)
	
Navigation modifiers are functions in other apps that can modify the navigation. They can add, remove,
reorder navigation nodes. 

#TODO: more docs needed


CMS_APPHOOKS
------------

A touble with python paths to CMSApp Classes.
Overwrites the auto-discovered list of CMSApp Classes located in applications cms_app.py.


Example::

	CMS_APPLICATIONS_URLS = (
    	'myapp.cms_app.MyApp',
    	'otherapp.cms_app.MyFancyApp',
    	'sampleapp.cms_app.SampleApp',
	)


CMS_UNIQUE_SLUGS
------------------

Example::

	CMS_UNIQUE_SLUGS = True

-------------

Example::

	CMS_SOFTROOT = True
	
This adds a new field "softroot" to you advanced-settings tab in the page.
If a page is marked as softroot the menu will only display the items till the softroot. If you have a huge site you can partition the menu with this.

CMS_HIDE_UNTRANSLATED
-----------------------

	CMS_HIDE_UNTRANSLATED = False
	
By default django-cms hides the menu items that are not translated yet in the current language. With this setting set to False they will show up anyway.

CMS_LANGUAGES
--------------

Which language should be used by the cms?

Example::

	CMS_LANGUAGES = (

	)
	
Default is LANGUAGES. Be sure that you don't have more language in here than in the LANGUAGES setting.

Example::

	CMS_LANGUAGE_FALLBACK = True
	
This will redirect the browser to the same page in an other language if the page is not available in the current language.

Configures on how to order the fallbacks for languages.

Example::

	CMS_LANGUAGE_CONF = {
		'de': ['en', 'fr'],
		'en': ['de'],
	}

CMS_SITE_LANGUAGES
------------------

If you have more then one site and CMS_LANGUAGES differs between the site you may want to fill this out so 
if you switch between the sites in the admin you only get the languages available on this site.

	CMS_SITE_LANGUAGES = {
		1:['en','de'],
		2:['en','fr'],
	    3:['en'],
	}
	
	
CMS_FRONTEND_LANGUAGES
