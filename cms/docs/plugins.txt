Plugins
=======

File
----

Allows you to upload a file. A filetype icon will be assigned based on the file extension.

For installation be sure you have the following in the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting
in your project's ``settings.py`` file::

	INSTALLED_APPS = (
		# ...
		'cms.plugins.file',
		# ...
	)

Flash
-----

Allows you to upload and display a Flash SWF file on your page.

For installation be sure you have the following in the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting
in your project's ``settings.py`` file::

	INSTALLED_APPS = (
		# ...
		'cms.plugins.flash',
		# ...
	)
	

GoogleMap
---------

Displays a map of an address on your page.

For installation be sure you have the following in the ``INSTALLED_APPS``
setting in your project's ``settings.py`` file::

	INSTALLED_APPS = (
		# ...
		'cms.plugins.googlemap',
		# ...
	)
	
The Google Maps API key is also required.
You can either put this in a project setting called ``GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY``
or be sure the template context has a variable with the same name.

Link
----

Displays a link to an arbitrary URL or to a page. If a page is moved the URL will still be correct.

For installation be sure to have the following in the ``INSTALLED_APPS``
setting in your project's ``settings.py`` file::

	INSTALLED_APPS = (
		# ...
		'cms.plugins.link',
		# ...
	)

Picture
-------

Displays a picture in a page.

For installation be sure you have the following in the ``INSTALLED_APPS``
setting in your project's ``settings.py`` file::

	INSTALLED_APPS = (
		# ...
		'cms.plugins.picture',
		# ...
	)
	
If you want to resize the picture you can get a thumbnail library. We recommend
`sorl.thumbnail <http://code.google.com/p/sorl-thumbnail/>`_.
In your project template directory create a folder called ``cms/plugins`` and create a file
called ``picture.html`` in there.
Here is an example ``picture.html`` template::

	{% load i18n thumbnail %}
	{% spaceless %}
	
	{% if picture.url %}<a href="{{ picture.url }}">{% endif %}
	{% ifequal placeholder "content" %}
		<img src="{% thumbnail picture.image.name 484x1500 upscale %}" {% if picture.alt %}alt="{{ picture.alt }}" {% endif %}/>
	{% endifequal %}
	{% ifequal placeholder "teaser" %}
		<img src="{% thumbnail picture.image.name 484x1500 upscale %}" {% if picture.alt %}alt="{{ picture.alt }}" {% endif %}/>
	{% endifequal %}
	{% if picture.url %}</a>{% endif %}
	
	{% endspaceless %}

In this template the picture is scaled differently based on which placeholder it was placed in.

Snippet
-------

Just renders some HTML snippet. Mostly used for development or hackery.

For installation be sure you have the following in the ``INSTALLED_APPS``
setting in your project's ``settings.py`` file::

in your project's ``settings.py`` file::

		# ...
	)
